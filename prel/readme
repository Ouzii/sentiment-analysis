This directory contains the preliminary/development datasets for Finnish, French, and Italian.

The data is compiled by extracting the sentences for which both annotators agreed that the sentiment was preserved. This yields a
dataset with 100% inter-annotator agreement on sentiment preservation in the scope of this project.

The data can be used as a preliminary/development set for compiling larger datasets for sentence-level sentiment classification. For
example, this data may serve as a seed sentence set.
