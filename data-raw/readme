This directory contains the data used in this project organized by:
    - classification type: bin / multi
    - language: en / fi / fr / it
    
With the multi-dimensional classification data for each translated language, OPUS corpus sentence alignments between English and
that language are included for both training and testing sets in each the /ids/ directory.

The /ids/ directory for English contains the source document of each sentence. As there are misalignments in the original corpus files,
some of those misalignments are likely to have been carried over to these files.
