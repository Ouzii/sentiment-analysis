This directory contains the data used in this project organized by:
	- classification type: bin / multi
	- language: en / fi / fr / it
    
With the multi-dimensional classification data for each translated language, OPUS corpus sentence alignments between English and
that language are included for both training and testing sets in each the /ids/ directory.

The /ids/ directory for English contains the source document of each sentence.

As there are misalignments in the original corpus files, some of those misalignments are likely to have been carried over to these files.
Additionally, some misalignments may have shown up in the data preprocessing.

Known alignment issues:

	- A few lines at the end of each Italian and French alignment file seem misaligned (probable cause: error in preprocessing for this project)
	- A few lines here and there in the English and Finnish alignment files are misaligned (probable cause: error in corpus source)
