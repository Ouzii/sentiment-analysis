This repo contains the code and data used in my Master's thesis in Language Technology at the University of Helsinki.

The text data used in this project is taken from:

Lison, P. and Tiedemann, J. (2016), OpenSubtitles2016: Extracting large parallel corpora from movie and tv subtitles, _in_ 'Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2016)'.

The code is implemented in Python 3.x using Scikit-learn:

Pedregosa, F., Varoquaux, G., Granfort, A., Michel, V., Thirion, B., Grisel, O., Blondel, M., Prettenhofer, P., Weiss, R., Dubourg, V., Vanderplas, J., Passos, A., Cournapeau, D., Brucher, M., Perrot, M. and Duchesnay, E. (2011), 'Scikit-learn: Machine learning in Python', _Journal of Machine Learning Research_ 12, 2825-2830.
