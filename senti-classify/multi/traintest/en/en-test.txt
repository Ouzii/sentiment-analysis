Don't kick me, I won't shut up.
I don't like reporters.
Scram the son of a bitch.
Goddamn it, do something.
Damn it, shut up!
No way Uncle Joe is going to talk me into cutting celery again.
I told you never to ask me how I feel.
If that's humor, don't bother.
It's just not that cute anymore.
So the basic problem is that I'm still around?
What do you mean, I'm not the type?
Will you shut up about the Army?
I don't think so and I don't care and I don't have the time.
Don't make me shoot you.
Any of you guys call me Francis, and I'll kill you.
You don't know a damn thing about soldiering.
I ain't talking about that crap!
Look, if you don't want me in your Army, kick me out... but get off my back.
The absence of a plan is ridiculous.
You are in trouble!
What the hell do you think that I do?
I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes!
Why you gotta shout?
If not, get the fuck off my car!
What am I, a fuckin' stranger?
Mind your own business, would you?
Who the hell are you to ask all these questions?
And I don't care whether you go down with him or not.
What's this bullshit?
Just stay out of this.
You're dead, you sons of bitches.
I've called you dozens of times.
Don't raise your voice to me.
I can raise my voice in my own home.
Stop yelling.
I hate this whole thing.
You're not telling me everything.
I'm not hiding from anybody or anything!
Die, you bastard!
I want those two guys banished from her life.
Will you let me sleep?
You stay away from my baby.
And you can't make me.
Shoot him!
All right, Savannah, that's enough.
You get in trouble over there, and I'd have a hell of a time gettin' you out.
I can't afford a fuckin' dream house!
Hey, Beef, if Charlie says the van was empty, the van was empty.
You should have learned by now!
I won't let Jessica live like this.
I'm not coming in there!
If you have something to say, say it and get out.
I hate when you do that.
I'm not going down there to get a tan.
Why must I always be the one who puts the cat out.
There's no bloody exits.
Get the fuck out of this country.
Shut the fucking blinds, will you?
You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities.
Charlie, you had no right to do something like that.
You are so infuriating.
Why don't you leave me alone when I'm sleeping?
I'll get a lock on my door and keep your ass out of here, Mookie.
I hate this frigging place.
Why don't you both shut up?
Turn the fucking water off!
I hate this place. I hate this place.
You really think you know what's best for us, Pino?
I don't care if you fire me this exact fucking moment.
If you're saying what I'm thinking you're saying, you better not say it because I don't wanna hear it.
Get out of here!
Nobody gives a shit, believe me!
I don't owe you jack shit.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
I should have taken the bus.
Shut up and get your ass here!
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
No, I told you I don't wanna do that anymore.
So this is what it's gonna be, huh?
I'm gonna see it if I have to go blind trying.
I strongly suggest you don't mess with G-Fresh anymore!
You mess with him, we mess with you!
I don't want the money if this is how you have to earn it!
I hate you!
What the fuck?
Goddamn it.
Leave me alone.
What the fuck are you on about?
Get out of the way!
What's the matter with you?
What the fuck?
Son of a bitch!
Maybe we can go get a drink?
Do you feel like having Italian tonight?
You like that Beaujolais don't you?
Have you found your perfect woman yet?
Don't start without me.
Don't have a boyfriend?
How did it go?
Let's go to bed.
And you will call me in a couple of days.
Let's go and see my cousin.
I have information for you.
You wanna run get me some?
I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Well, I can tell you some stories.
However, just at the moment, I have drinking to do.
Heard you walking around in here, figured I'd drop by.
What does that say?
Just give me some coffee, will you, babe?
I was wondering if your guy could treat my pool.
Let's hear more about Earl.
I'm gonna take another picture.
You like fishing?
Hey, did you collect from the Ryans yet?
And I'm gonna make you a pussycat.
Well, we should probably eat, is what we should do.
And there's this great CÃ©zanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce.
I'd like to speak to...
And when you win Oscars, both of you, you'll look in the camera and thank me.
You wanna dance?
I need to get up to see some people named Kittredge.
Are you in tonight?
If you let me stay with you, I'll tell you.
But I'll meet you at the Waverly movie theatre.
How long is your program?
They'll throw a parade for you.
How do I look?
We can get cheap tickets from Jessica's parents.
Jonah, bring some of that stuff.
Maybe when I come back, the two of us ought to spend some time alone.
Can I get you a drink?
I wanted to surprise you.
I just invited him to dinner.
Shall we play ball, boys?
Let's see what we have here for our guests.
Let me have a taste of it.
Let me see.
Come on, it'll be great.
After last night, I think she's looking forward to it.
The sooner you get that, the better off we're all gonna be.
Can you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is?
I want to show you something.
Let me talk to her again.
No time to be shy, ladies.
Let me be the first to welcome you to this afternoon's campaign banquet.
I have something for you.
Tonight, we will feast in his honour.
I want to hear everything you've been doing.
The rest of you will play Peter and Wendy's friends.
I want to play the pain in Peter.
I want to bring the same truth to this role that I brought to Guppy the newsboy in Hey, Hey, It's Guppy!
I thought that's when my life really began.
Then we'll have brunch by my private lake.
I'd love to hear how Junior's doing and, well, it would be fun being with you.
Get me some punch.
Now, they're probably gonna crown us King and Queen of the Costume Ball.
The time in Paris will be so good for you.
Listen, when you guys meet her, just try to make me look good.
It'll save my life.
You got a minute?
Now that you got that, we must teach you how to dress.
I'm going to college but hoping to do volunteer work in the summer.
I got plenty I can do on my own in Las Vegas!
That stuff will knock your socks off.
I'm sure you'll be happy with Wayne Newton.
Why don't you go sing something?
Wanna go have some fun?
Ben, do you think people will see this video in Utah?
I want you to meet this young lady, okay?
We expect the best from you.
Why don't we go and celebrate at some nice, quiet little restaurant?
Let's have a word, sugar puss.
I'll see you later.
What's the good news?
Let's go!
You don't give a shit about him.
I'm tired of this baby crap!
This goddamn town thinks you're as chicken as they come.
Coco sounds like she caught the old man cheating again.
You think the clowns took him up and hung him in the yard?
You made Case feel like shit tonight 'cause he was scared.
You took him to a freaky fortune lady who scared the shit...
What's your problem, jerk off?
Mr Deveraux, you've really chapped my ass and I've had just about enough.
Goddamn, that thing's got more holes than my daddy's rubber.
Because we are food for worms, lads.
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say means shit to you, does it, Todd?
Your breath stinks.
Every day, you give this azupep a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.
He don't even work.
Look, Doctor, this ain't Korea or China or wherever you come from.
Who told you to step up on my sneakers?
It's disrespectful.
Do your friends put money in your pocket, Pino?
Why don't you get a fucking job, man?
You haven't got the balls to boycott me.
I don't pay you good money to have you jerk me around.
Summertime, all you can smell is the garbage.
God damn, I better not see her naked on payday.
Of course I'm sweating, you moron.
Tina, you don't got a forehead, you got a eight-head.
You're fucking stabbing me in the back, man.
You don't fuck with my box!
Why don't you get a fucking life?
Your money couldn't begin to pay for the window you broke.
Shot by a mad pharmacist or run over by a car while fleeing from police pursuit.
I'll shoot the son of a bitch in the balls!
Who are you to dictate the terms?
She got what she deserves.
And sometimes I think some junkie nurse may be stepping on my medication.
I might have been a lot of things, but I never was a tramp.
He pumps his face full of Novocaine, and then, with his scalpel begins to slice away his features one by one.
I'll be stuck here doing your work while you run all over the city fighting crime or something.
He likes to kick the shit out of white trash like you, boy.
Now we have all the assholes in one room.
Three years I've been waiting to nail your sorry ass.
I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage!
Stronger mouthwash might be nice.
I'm gonna be sick.
Somebody ought to get their ass kicked for this mess.
Jeffrey's too strange and I'm too fat.
Why did you lie to me?
Wipe that fucking smile off your face!
So, now I'm supposed to roll over like a bitch dog getting my belly scratched?
But, God, people can be rude.
People can be goddamn cruel.
Those two lovebirds next door driving you nuts?
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump.
What a dump.
Look how stupid you're acting.
Hey, don't piss on any firewood!
He's such a liar.
You're making me sick!
I hate when you use the word "superfluous".
You gave a stranger who happens to mention my name the keys to our house?
Mom said sleeping with you was like sleeping with a salad with bad dressing!
This kid, bulldozing his way into our lives.
Who, in your high school, has become homosexual or is deep into drugs?
I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy.
You picked up that awful thing to show us your contempt.
These heels are grotesque.
You want to sit around drinking and feeling sorry for yourself.
But I can't express myself monosyllabically enough for you to understand 'em all.
I love tits as much as any guy... ..but why would I pay some hag money for some supernatural chicanery... ..coupled with sagging, wrinkled boobs?
You got something against fat people, too?
It can look like Ratcliffe's knickers for all I care, just as long as I get off this stinking boat!
What can you expect from filthy little heathens?
They're savages, savages
Come on, you flabby old goat, give it to me.
That's why your wife dumped you.
These stalls are awfully dirty and they're backed up.
Ten years of tap dancing lessons and this is how you repay me?
That ought to teach those Moonies to stay away from my house.
Those dirty bastards!
Way too much weird stuff goes on here.
Oh, this place is such a mess.
Yeah, he's a first-class asshole, that's for sure.
I want you to know that I hate your fucking guts.
You can just fucking die, you fuck.
What is it with you boys and your war toys?
I don't make deals with peasants!
You're lying.
Edie, they'll kill you too.
This looks like a mind-fuck to me.
I worry about you, that's all.
School's gonna be a problem for the kids.
It tried to kill my Raymond!
It's a monster!
She had a bit of an accident back there.
You know, Pran is not gonna last five minutes out there.
Please I don't want anyone to be bad to my wife.
I'm trapped, Sydney.
I fear really fear for the future.
You'll land us all in prison.
This means Siberia, for sure.
I'm not ready for this.
To tell you the truth, New York frightens me.
I have to warn the Soviets in the clearest possible terms that they risk taking us to the brink of an armed confrontation with incalculable consequences for all mankind.
These terrorist attacks are aimed at you.
Anyone in your vicinity is in danger.
Isn't that rather exposing the First Lady to some risk?
I am not prepared for wells to run dry!
I think we're being set up.
Beth, you're making me very nervous.
Yeah, then why are you trying to hurt me?
You're scaring me.
Is Mommy going to be all right?
They'd never approve of that being released.
She pulls back on the trigger and at that moment I wake up screaming.
I had the most frightening experience.
I'm in a strange man surrounded by strangers in a strange room!
I can't breathe in here.
Benny, look out for the Red Car!
When he finds out, he's gonna be mad.
I think I'm gonna faint.
It's not going to be a problem, is it, Tess?
I don't know what the hell to do.
It's gonna be a massacre.
We've to get out of here and get help!
They really do know where I'm hiding, Geoffrey?
It's a trap.
Right in the middle of our celebration... the firebase got hit by a mortar attack.
I'm trapped.
You know what would happen if Chet found out?
Get out while we're still ahead and alive.
I want you to be on fucking guard, man.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.
So what's gonna happen to me?
Are you trying to get me killed?
Your parents'll kill me.
Are you gonna shoot me?
Somebody help me, please.
I don't want any trouble.
That's dangerous.
Are you following me?
It's a cruel disease.
Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
What is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match what's out there?
Paul could've been killed by that intruder.
She's going to die if you don't help me.
Guns make me nervous.
But they're all dead.
I need your help.
Watch your head.
Be careful.
Is he dead?
What happened?
Get down!
It was an accident.
Help me!
Something's wrong.
Somebody help me!
Really, I've never been happier.
I like it!
Things were going wonderfully well.
You're the prettiest woman in the room, sweetheart.
It was very nice to meet you.
Yeah, he's alive and well and living in Phoenix.
As a matter of fact, you look great.
You're so beautiful.
Well, we've been very happy here.
We've been very happy here.
Wasn't that wonderful?
Adiran, I'm just very happy to be here.
I got a great personality, you ask anybody.
Hey, it's another delightful day here in vacation land.
I know you're crazy about me.
There is nothing like a good cigar.
She's a beautiful tough cookie.
Actually, I'm feeling pretty relaxed now.
You sure are pretty.
I really liked the idea.
This is great!
The town is perfectly all right.
I love this!
It's nice to have company for tea.
They gave me a piece of candy in the store.
You're positively an incredible human being.
And in the enchantment of the moment, we'd let poetry work its magic.
Spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen.
For the first time in my whole life, I know what I want to do.
The most beautiful poetry can be about simple things like a cat, or a flower, or rain.
I was good.
I was really good.
I'll hit you with nine quarters per package, and that's just cos I'm feeling good.
We got a good thing goin' here.
It's good for the soul.
That's a nice outfit.
I love it.
Isn't technology wonderful?
God, that's beautiful.
It's so nice out there.
Isn't she gorgeous?
My heart is packed so full of love for you.
Now, these legs are very nice.
Excellent!
Very good!
Oh, very nice.
This is good.
You make me very happy.
Is that a fine-lookin' woman or what?
Chad had a great time.
Wally had a great time.
A smokin' good time.
They send you champagne.
How wonderful!
Isn't this the finest time?
I want to get down on my knees and thank God.
I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place, what got me into this.
Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky.
We came outside giddy and reeling.
That is a beautiful thing.
That night was the happiest night I ever had.
That was the happiest night he ever had.
That was magical, that Salinger stuff.
I only have sex when I'm happy.
This is really fun.
People who truly loved are likely to love again.
Thank Victoria for the nice dinner.
I'm glad you liked it.
I love the smell of commerce in the morning!
Where do you get those wonderful toys?
Seriously, she is a woman who loves our great state.
Look at all the smiling faces.
I'm so glad you've come home safely.
Ever since the first day I laid eyes on you, I knew I had to be yours and yours alone.
Your hair looks nice today.
I think I've finally found a sport I like.
Boy, you sure are a good-looker.
That's why audiences love me.
That sounds swell, Corky.
I think you're cute.
If your mother were alive, she'd be so happy.
Lunch was wonderful.
I got offered a part in a movie.
Oh, you're the best, Joe.
It does feel better to get it out.
Go on, give yourself a treat.
Oh, you make me so hot!
I have an idea!
I love him.
I love it.
What a pleasure.
It's good.
That was fun.
How thoughtful.
Perfect.
Well, that's easy.
Home sweet home.
Great!
That's sweet.
It'll be broken by dinner.
No, I just thought we could spend the day together.
I get pissed off, my wife gets embarrassed, the kids are confused.
Carol hits the ceiling and throws me out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, you know...
I'm talking too much.
The Shaffer woman died today.
My father's in the hospital again.
You can at least, for Christ's sake... lie to me.
I don't feel so good.
Maybe he's got the flu or something
We know you're sad, buddy, but you gotta go to school.
I have no idea what to do.
It's too late for that, Victor.
I wish I could have made her understand.
The queue was endless.
I hate my life.
They said I was crazy, so they sent me to a mental hospital.
It's a bit humiliating, always borrowing Anatoly's place.
I think I care too much.
I have worked and struggled to make myself an American.
I didn't mean it that way.
When I think of that kid, I want to cry.
Because it was my misery.
Now you know that the saddest thing in the world is life.
Our lives are woven together in a fabric, but the connections that make society strong also make it vulnerable.
And then three weeks ago I suffered a nervous breakdown.
When we first went there, Ben, he could barely speak.
When Michael died, Erica was only five.
You think you should have done something different but it's not your fault that Erica died.
My father died of a heart attack.
I had no right to put you through all that.
Don't look so depressed.
Teddy never made it.
Little Katie's been so lonely...
I've been stuck here for 20 years.
It isn't like it used to be.
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.
And he will be missed.
It's hard being a dope fiend.
Yeah, but he's not gonna take me along any more, is he?
Don't know if I'm ever gonna get my nails done now.
This kid's cryin', man.
I promised your father I'd take care of you.
I just hate to see a good man go to waste.
If Helen found out, it would kill her.
This is a very sad day for me.
I didn't mean to scare you.
I guess this must seem pretty pathetic to a guy like you.
I feel like such a fool.
Well, you know, there wasn't much we could do.
Mom, Casey died.
He got run over by a car.
My grandparents were killed in the war.
Our kids, struggling through their lives.
Everyone sees this thing except me.
As it is, this is not the life I want for our children, for myself and for you.
She just seems, I don't know, lonely.
This is not my day.
I could burn in hell for the lies I told about you.
And what most people don't see... is just how hard it is to do the right thing.
I'd be so happy if that were really true, Evelyn.
I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason.
Sorry about that.
That's not good.
She's gone.
You're killing me.
I can't do this.
I miss you too.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I can't do this anymore.
So it really is the same old Sparky that we all knew and loved.
Don't you want to go to New York?
I thought they said they was from Rome.
You sound further away than that.
You're happy all the time?
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I sit up and wonder where I am.
You don't like jazz, pal?
How'd they know you were on this train?
I thought they were with Mackenzie.
Fritz, are you leaving the company or something?
Is that what you're worried about?
Oh, God, it even has a barn.
What brings you back so early?
I didn't know you were a music aficionado.
I haven't seen you around their office, though.
Why should today be any different, you know what I mean?
It's funny, she didn't mention a husband.
I can't believe it myself.
Hey, who turned out the lights?
I just saved your life, and you still don't trust me?
You look different.
You walk awful fast for a little thing don't you?
Damn Charley, this is your last wish?
Look at all that underwear.
Why's she making those funny noises?
That's not bad for a blind man.
Isn't this the same desk...?
I don't know what to say.
Where are the females?
I haven't seen you for a week.
I saw it, but I didn't believe it.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?
That's very rare.
I thought politics interested you.
How did you find that out?
Oh, that's what you're working on?
I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow.
Daddy, you found Suzy!
You sure this is the right address?
Why is there a statue of a husky?
Oh, this is a Kandinsky!
He promised you parts in Cats?
You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel?
So, I heard you we're going to propose to Brandi Svenning in some theme park.
You have the most unusual name, too.
This is a better game than I thought.
I wondered why I was suddenly being treated with respect.
Look at all these happy families.
My goodness, you have such an attractive little garden here.
I don't think I've seen you before.
Unbelievable.
Oh, my goodness.
Holy shit.
You're kidding, right?
Wow!
Oh, my God.
It's unbelievable.
It's a miracle.
I don't believe it.
Are you serious?
Oh, my God!
Why am I here?
Why are you here?
Holy shit.
Are you kidding?
How do you know?
I've done what I can for you.
I'd really like to help you.
Tell me the truth.
It's OK, I was thinking the same thing.
Well, we'll figure something out.
I'm sure there is a very logical explanation for all this.
I won't leave you.
I'd prefer it if it was you.
That's what friends are for.
Are you feeling well, Anatoly?
I think it's safe.
Thank you for protection.
I respect your new life.
You've been greatest friend to me.
My mother and dad'll help us, I'm sure they will.
If central government should ever fail, power can be transferred instead to a system of local officials dispersed across the country.
We thought you'd be safer on the ground.
I've always had faith in him.
I learned it from you, Fritz.
Phil Nozaki was a good cop.
Yes, I was responsible.
You don't have to thank me.
I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't been there.
And we learned a lot from you.
Jack, since you're not going on the cruise, I could use you at the store on Monday.
I need a lift home.
No, honey the drink's on me.
It almost feels like you're one of us now.
And it's like she wants to be my mentor, which is exactly what I needed.
You're in no particular danger, I think.
I'll need help bathing and changing.
I heard you're having some trouble finding help.
Thank you for keeping us alive.
We're your family now, Chavez.
You are my only hope.
I supply arms and equipment to anyone who will pay the price.
They are perfectly safe.
Hold my hand, please?
I think you might be my best brother, too.
You got to learn how to forgive.
I know I can always count on you.
Even though it may seem silly or wrong, you must try.
You see, Pino, this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that.
We want to thank you all for making our lives just a little brighter, here on We Love Radio.
I may smack you around every once in a while, but I'm still your brother.
Sal, I gotta go see my son, if it's all right with you.
Tom knew his way around the old neighbourhoods.
I'd known Tom since I was an altar boy.
I know the feeling.
He's really been like a father to me.
I need you to give me some money.
He's a real pro.
Helen and I really did care about you.
But our kid will have a loving mother and father, and all the advantages that I can give him.
I could sure use your help.
Yeah, let's talk business, my friend
We're together on that, aren't we?
You need a hand with those?
You can depend on me for an additional overcall of 250.
He was very understanding.
Well, I'm going to trust you.
You deserve a nice, clean place.
I got faith in you.
This is the right path for you.
How can we ever repay you?
Can you share with me?
I understand.
Close your eyes.
I've got a surprise for you.
Follow me.
No more tears.
Don't worry.
Maybe you're right.
Let me explain something to you.
Promise me.
I really appreciate that.
I have something for you.
Can you explain that to me?
Let's be honest.
Good boy.
Don't worry.
I know he was your friend.
I promise.
